After uploading the code, the light bulbs turn on in order!

## I find that I can use markdown skillfully now, thank you phoenix!
# Final project
I did a lot of research this week. And I finally know how to do it.
I have bought some parts, but they are still on the way.
## Magnetic switch
I found that I could connect a magnetic switch with a Led. When the switch is turned on, the Led lights up.

## Color sensor
Last time we said it could only recognize three colors. But after investigating, I found that it can recognize several colors.
