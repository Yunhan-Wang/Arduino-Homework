This game explores the relationship between color and music.  Players make their own cards and put a card on the mechine.Then they need to press the start button(input1). The mechine has a color sensor(input2) to read the color of different positions on the card. Then it will play the corresponding song according to the proportion of the color on the card. Colors have emotional tendencies, and so does music. So I really want to use this mechine to connect colors to music to create synesthesia.

The form of the sticker was inspired by the artist Yayoi Kusama.

## Idea2 I Believe 

Input1:infrared induction（On the clothes）

Input2:touch sensors

Output1:music

Output2:shake

It's a game that two people cooperate with each other. The first step is for the two players to wear cloth with sensors(input1). Then the game starts. Player A's sensor vibrates(output1), and player A quickly tells player B where the sensor is. If player B taps the right sensor(input2), the game continues with some warning tone（output2）. This game tests the cooperation of two people. As long as one person is wrong, the game can't go on.


## Finally, We decided to take  Idea1 and refine it next. 
Phoenix suggested that I use the camera instead of the color sensor.
But then there's only one input，I need to think of another one. 
And I realized that it had to be meaningful to my concept.
* Next I should think about what my input is and what components I need.
