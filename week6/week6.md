### 01 Light sensor 
We used three different capacitors and found that the lower the capacitance of the capacitor we use, the higher the frequency of the oscillator.

#### At the beginning 
We thought it worked，but it is a wrong circuit.
I think maybe the I think it's because the positive pin and negative pin of the speaker were connected wrong.
